## Code of Conduct

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as
soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value
of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you
make our event a better place.

## Setup

We will be using the Python programming language for the workshop, as well as
several third-party packages. All of it is free and open source. Here is the
link to the Anaconda version of Python that we suggest you use:

- [Anaconda Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/)

You will also need to install the Distant Viewing Toolkit. The easiest way to
do this is to run the following command, either from your from your terminal
(macOS or Linux) or from the Anaconda prompt:

```
pip3 install dvt
```

Finally, you will also need to get the data and code for the workshop. You can
grab those from here:

- [dvt-workshop.zip]()

Unzip the file, start a Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda prompt, and open the
first notebook to begin!

## References

During the workshop, we will construct a bibliography of references for both
technical and conceptual topics that arise.
